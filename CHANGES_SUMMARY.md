# Humigence Training Reliability Fix - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive changes made to fix the training reliability issues in Humigence, ensuring that the wizard flows reliably into actual training without crashes due to common configuration and initialization errors.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: 'QLoRATrainer' object has no attribute 'runs_dir'
- **Problem**: The `runs_dir` attribute was being accessed before it was defined in the `_setup_training` method.
- **Solution**: Moved `runs_dir` definition to the very beginning of `__init__` before any other setup methods are called.

### 2. TrainingArguments Schema Mismatches
- **Problem**: Different versions of transformers have different parameter names (e.g., `evaluation_strategy` vs `eval_strategy`).
- **Solution**: Created `validate_training_arguments_compatibility()` function that detects the installed transformers version and returns compatible arguments.

### 3. FSDP Configuration Conflicts
- **Problem**: Both `fsdp` and `fsdp_full_shard` flags could be active simultaneously, causing conflicts.
- **Solution**: Implemented `validate_fsdp_config()` that ensures mutual exclusivity and logs warnings when conflicts are resolved.

### 4. Empty Training Datasets
- **Problem**: Preprocessing could result in empty training datasets without clear error messages.
- **Solution**: Added `PreprocessingEmptyTrainError` and validation in the preprocessing pipeline to catch this early.

### 5. Training Readiness Validation
- **Problem**: No systematic validation that all prerequisites are met before starting training.
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive `TrainingReadinessGate` that validates datasets, directories, and configuration before training begins.

## Files Modified

### 1. `humigence/training_gate.py` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Centralized training readiness validation
- **Key Functions**:
  - `validate_training_readiness()`: Ensures all prerequisites are met
  - `validate_fsdp_config()`: Resolves FSDP conflicts
  - `validate_training_arguments_compatibility()`: Version-aware TrainingArguments

### 2. `humigence/train.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed `runs_dir` initialization order
  - Integrated training readiness gate
  - Updated `_build_training_args()` to use compatibility helpers
  - Added proper error handling for training readiness failures

### 3. `humigence/preprocess.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `PreprocessingEmptyTrainError` exception
  - Enhanced `preprocess()` method to check for empty training datasets
  - Better error messages for preprocessing failures

### 4. `humigence/cli.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced error handling in `run_pipeline()`
  - Added specific handling for `PreprocessingEmptyTrainError`
  - Improved error messages with actionable remediation steps
  - Better training flow control

### 5. `humigence/wizard.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced dataset source selection with fallback handling
  - Added `_source_path` setting for config updates
  - Improved error handling for bundled dataset copying
  - Increased demo dataset size from 12 to 20 samples

### 6. `humigence/config.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `save_config_atomic()` with better path handling
  - Improved directory creation and path expansion
  - Better error handling and atomic operations

### 7. `humigence/model_utils.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `ensure_model_available()` with better error messages
  - Added fallback handling for config update failures
  - More detailed troubleshooting guidance

### 8. `humigence/tests/test_training_gate.py` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for the training readiness gate
- **Coverage**: Tests for all validation functions and error conditions

## New Features

### 1. Training Readiness Gate
- Validates datasets have sufficient samples
- Ensures all required directories exist
- Checks configuration compatibility
- Provides clear error messages for failures

### 2. Version-Aware TrainingArguments
- Automatically detects transformers version
- Uses appropriate parameter names for each version
- Prevents schema mismatch errors

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific exception types for different failure modes
- Actionable error messages with remediation steps
- Graceful fallbacks where possible

### 4. Improved Dataset Handling
- Fallback from bundled dataset to generated demo
- Better validation of dataset sources
- Increased demo dataset size for more reliable training

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- All training gate functions have comprehensive test coverage
- Tests verify error conditions and edge cases
- Mock-based testing for isolated validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Wizard → Pipeline → Training**: Complete flow with bundled demo
2. **Training Disabled**: Pipeline runs without training (safety preserved)
3. **FSDP Conflicts**: Automatic resolution with warnings
4. **Empty Datasets**: Clear error messages with guidance
5. **Model Download Failures**: Detailed troubleshooting steps

## Safety Features Preserved

- **Training disabled by default**: Requires `--train` flag or `TRAIN=1` environment variable
- **Atomic config saves**: Prevents corruption during updates
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Continues operation when possible
- **Clear warnings**: Users are informed of any automatic changes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training Flow
```bash
# Run wizard and immediately start training
humigence init --run pipeline --train

# Run pipeline with existing config
humigence pipeline --config my_config.json --train
```

### Training Disabled (Default)
```bash
# Run pipeline without training
humigence pipeline --config my_config.json

# Set environment variable to enable
TRAIN=1 humigence pipeline --config my_config.json
```

## Expected Outcomes

After these changes, users should experience:

1. **Reliable Training Start**: No more crashes due to missing attributes or schema mismatches
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Single, actionable messages when issues occur
3. **Automatic Problem Resolution**: FSDP conflicts resolved, version compatibility handled
4. **Consistent Flow**: Wizard always flows into pipeline, pipeline always flows into training (when enabled)
5. **Better Debugging**: Specific error types and detailed troubleshooting guidance

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive validation for model compatibility
- Implement training progress monitoring and early stopping
- Add support for distributed training configurations
- Enhanced logging and telemetry for production use
